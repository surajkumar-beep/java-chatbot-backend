question,answer
What is a Design Pattern?,A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
Explain Singleton Pattern.,Singleton ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.

What is Builder Pattern?,Builder pattern constructs complex objects step by step.
Explain Prototype Pattern.,Prototype pattern creates new objects by cloning existing ones.
What is Adapter Pattern?,Adapter converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
What is Observer Pattern?,Observer allows objects to subscribe and get notified when another object changes state.
What is Strategy Pattern?,Strategy allows selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime.
What is Decorator Pattern?,Decorator adds behavior to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
What is Command Pattern?,"Command encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients."
What is Proxy Pattern?,Proxy provides a surrogate object that controls access to another object.
Explain MVC Pattern.,"MVC separates an application into Model, View, and Controller for better organization."
What is DAO Pattern?,"DAO abstracts database interactions, allowing data access logic to be separate from business logic."
Explain DTO Pattern.,DTO is used to transfer data between layers without exposing entities directly.
What is Template Method Pattern?,Template Method defines a skeleton of an algorithm and lets subclasses fill in specific steps.
What are Lambda Expressions?,Lambdas allow defining anonymous methods with concise syntax.
What is Functional Interface?,A functional interface contains exactly one abstract method.
What is Stream API?,"Stream API provides a functional way to process collections using map, filter, and reduce."
Explain Optional class.,Optional helps avoid null pointer exceptions by providing a container object.
What are default methods in interfaces?,Default methods allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking implementations.
Explain method references.,Method references provide shorthand for calling methods using '::' syntax.
What is map() in streams?,map() transforms each element of a stream and returns a new stream.
What is flatMap() in streams?,flatMap() flattens nested collections in a stream.
What are terminal operations in streams?,"Terminal operations include collect(), count(), forEach(), reduce(), etc."
Explain CompletableFuture.,CompletableFuture allows asynchronous programming with non-blocking calls.
Explain Optional.orElse().,orElse() returns a default value if Optional is empty.
What is JUnit?,JUnit is a Java testing framework for unit testing.
What is @Test annotation?,@Test marks a method as a test case in JUnit.
What is Mockito?,Mockito is a mocking framework used to simulate dependencies in tests.
Explain assertEquals() in JUnit.,assertEquals() checks whether two values are equal in a test.
What is TestNG?,TestNG is a testing framework that provides advanced features like dependency testing.
What is Maven?,Maven is a build automation tool that manages project dependencies and lifecycle.
What is Gradle?,Gradle is a build tool that uses Groovy/Kotlin DSL for flexible build scripts.
What is Jenkins?,"Jenkins automates builds, testing, and deployment in CI/CD pipelines."
What is Git?,Git is a distributed version control system for tracking code changes.
What is GitHub?,GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.
Explain version control.,Version control tracks changes and allows multiple developers to work on code simultaneously.
What is reflection in Java?,Reflection allows inspection and modification of classes and methods at runtime.
What is annotation processing?,Annotation processing generates code or performs validation at compile time.
What is garbage collection?,Garbage collection automatically removes unused objects from memory.
What is volatile keyword?,volatile ensures variable visibility across threads.
What is synchronization?,Synchronization ensures mutual exclusion in multithreaded environments.
What is ExecutorService?,ExecutorService manages and executes threads asynchronously.
What is ForkJoinPool?,ForkJoinPool executes tasks in parallel using work-stealing algorithm.
What is parallelStream()?,parallelStream() processes stream elements in parallel for faster performance.
What is collect() in streams?,collect() gathers stream results into a collection or value.
What is CompletableFuture.thenApply()?,thenApply() transforms the result of a CompletableFuture when it completes.
What is the difference between Collection and Stream?,Collection stores data; Stream processes data in a functional way.
Explain Predicate interface.,Predicate is a functional interface used to test a condition and return boolean.
Explain Supplier interface.,Supplier is a functional interface that returns a value without taking any input.
