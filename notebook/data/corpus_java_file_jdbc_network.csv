What is file handling in Java?,"File handling allows Java programs to read and write data to files on the disk using classes like File, FileReader, and FileWriter."
Which package is used for file handling?,The java.io and java.nio packages are used for file handling.
How to create a file in Java?,File f = new File('demo.txt'); f.createNewFile();
How to check if file exists?,File f = new File('data.txt'); if(f.exists()) System.out.println('Exists');
How to delete a file?,File f = new File('old.txt'); f.delete();
How to write to a file using FileWriter?,FileWriter fw = new FileWriter('out.txt'); fw.write('Hello'); fw.close();
How to read from file using FileReader?,FileReader fr = new FileReader('data.txt'); int ch; while((ch=fr.read())!=-1) System.out.print((char)ch); fr.close();
BufferedReader example,BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader('data.txt')); String line; while((line=br.readLine())!=null) System.out.println(line); br.close();
BufferedWriter example,BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter('out.txt')); bw.write('Hi'); bw.newLine(); bw.close();
Read file using Scanner,Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File('data.txt')); while(sc.hasNextLine()) System.out.println(sc.nextLine()); sc.close();
How to get file size?,File f = new File('data.txt'); System.out.println(f.length());
How to list all files in a directory?,File dir = new File('C:/folder'); for(File f : dir.listFiles()) System.out.println(f.getName());
How to check if path is directory?,f.isDirectory();
What is absolute path in Java?,It is the full path of a file or directory returned by f.getAbsolutePath().
What is java.nio package?,It is a non-blocking I/O package for faster file and network operations.
Read all lines using NIO Files class,List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get('data.txt'));
Write to file using NIO,"Files.write(Paths.get('output.txt'), 'Hello'.getBytes());"
Copy file using NIO,"Files.copy(Paths.get('a.txt'), Paths.get('b.txt'), StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);"
Delete file using NIO,Files.delete(Paths.get('a.txt'));
What is serialization?,Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
Serializable example,class Student implements Serializable { int id; String name; }
What is transient keyword?,It prevents serialization of specific fields.
How to deserialize an object?,ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream('obj.txt')); Student s = (Student)in.readObject();
What is JDBC?,JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is an API to connect and execute queries on a database.
Which package provides JDBC classes?,java.sql package.
Steps to connect JDBC to database,1. Load driver 2. Create connection 3. Create statement 4. Execute query 5. Close connection.
JDBC connection example,"Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection('jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db','user','pass');"
Execute SELECT query example,Statement st = con.createStatement(); ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery('SELECT * FROM emp');
What is PreparedStatement?,It is used to execute parameterized queries efficiently.
PreparedStatement example,"PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement('INSERT INTO emp VALUES (?,?)'); ps.setInt(1,1); ps.setString(2,'John'); ps.executeUpdate();"
What is ResultSet?,It is a table of data returned by executing a query.
How to iterate ResultSet?,while(rs.next()){ System.out.println(rs.getString(1)); }
Close JDBC connection,con.close();
What is networking in Java?,Networking allows communication between computers over a network using java.net package.
What is Socket in Java?,Socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines.
ServerSocket example,ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(6666); Socket s = ss.accept(); DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());
Client socket example,"Socket s = new Socket('localhost',6666); DataOutputStream dout = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream()); dout.writeUTF('Hello');"
What is InetAddress class?,InetAddress represents IP address of a host.
How to read data from URL in Java?,URL url = new URL('https://example.com'); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(url.openStream()));
What is HttpURLConnection?,HttpURLConnection is used to send HTTP requests and receive responses.
HttpURLConnection GET example,HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) new URL('https://api.com').openConnection(); con.setRequestMethod('GET');
What is DatagramSocket?,It is used for UDP connectionless communication.
DatagramPacket example,"byte[] buf = new byte[1024]; DatagramPacket dp = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length, InetAddress.getByName('localhost'), 3000);"
Difference between TCP and UDP in Java,"TCP is connection-oriented (Socket/ServerSocket), UDP is connectionless (DatagramSocket)."
Get local host address example,InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getLocalHost(); System.out.println(addr.getHostAddress());
Get host name from IP example,InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName('8.8.8.8'); System.out.println(addr.getHostName());
Difference between InputStream and Reader classes,"InputStream reads bytes, Reader reads characters."
Difference between FileInputStream and FileReader,"FileInputStream reads binary data, FileReader reads character data."
